        <h1>ADHD</h1>
        <p>
            ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neuro-developmental disorder causing 
            persistent patterns of inattention (difficulty focusing) and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity 
            (excess movement, acting without thinking) that interfere with daily life, school, and
             work, often starting in childhood and continuing into adulthood. 
             People with ADHD have differences in brain development and function, leading to challenges 
             with focus, self-control, and staying still, though symptoms vary, with some having 
             more inattention, others more hyperactivity, and some both.
